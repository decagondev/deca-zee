# Product Requirements Document: Z-Machine Simulator for Zork 1

## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for developing a Python-based Z-Machine simulator to run Zork 1, a classic text adventure game. The Z-Machine is a virtual machine designed by Infocom to run interactive fiction games, and this simulator will interpret Zork 1's story file (`.z3` format) to provide a playable experience.

### 1.2 Scope
The Z-Machine simulator will:
- Read and parse Zork 1 story files (Z-Machine version 3).
- Emulate the Z-Machine's memory model, instruction set, and input/output systems.
- Support core gameplay features, including text output, user input, and game state management.
- Be implemented in Python for cross-platform compatibility.
- Focus on Zork 1 functionality, with potential extensibility for other Z-Machine version 3 games.

Non-goals:
- Support for Z-Machine versions other than version 3.
- Advanced features like sound or graphics (not used in Zork 1).
- Save/load game state (optional stretch goal).

## 2. Functional Requirements
### 2.1 Core Features
- **Story File Parsing**: Load and parse Zork 1 `.z3` files, validating header and memory structure.
- **Memory Management**: Implement the Z-Machine memory model (dynamic, static, and high memory).
- **Instruction Execution**: Support version 3 opcodes (e.g., `je`, `print`, `call`, `get_prop`, `input`).
- **Text Output**: Decode and display Z-Machine text (ZSCII encoding) to the console.
- **User Input**: Handle user text input for game commands.
- **Object System**: Manage the object tree for rooms, items, and properties.
- **Stack and Variables**: Implement the Z-Machine stack and local/global variable system.
- **Dictionary and Parsing**: Support Zork 1's dictionary for command parsing.

### 2.2 User Interface
- **Console-Based Interface**: Display game text and accept user input via a command-line interface.
- **Optional GUI (Stretch Goal)**: Provide a simple graphical interface using a library like Tkinter or PyQt.

### 2.3 Technical Requirements
- **Language**: Python 3.8+ for cross-platform compatibility.
- **File Format**: Support `.z3` files, specifically Zork 1's story file.
- **Performance**: Process instructions efficiently to ensure smooth gameplay.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle invalid opcodes, corrupted story files, or unexpected input.
- **Modularity**: Design the code to allow future extensions (e.g., other Z-Machine versions).

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Portability**: Run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Maintainability**: Use modular, well-documented code with clear separation of concerns (e.g., memory, interpreter, I/O).
- **Reliability**: Accurately emulate Zork 1 behavior, matching original gameplay.
- **Scalability**: Allow future additions like save/load or support for other version 3 games.

## 4. Technical Design
### 4.1 System Architecture
- **File Loader**: Reads and validates the `.z3` file, populating memory.
- **Memory Manager**: Handles dynamic, static, and high memory regions.
- **Instruction Decoder**: Parses and executes Z-Machine opcodes.
- **Text Decoder**: Converts ZSCII-encoded text to readable output.
- **Input Parser**: Processes user input using the story file's dictionary.
- **Object Manager**: Manages the Z-Machine object tree and properties.
- **Interpreter Loop**: Executes instructions, updates state, and handles I/O.

### 4.2 Data Structures
- **Memory**: Byte array for the story file, with pointers for PC, stack, and memory regions.
- **Stack**: List for call stack and local variables.
- **Object Table**: Dictionary or tree for objects, properties, and attributes.
- **Dictionary**: Lookup table for word parsing.

### 4.3 Key Algorithms
- **Instruction Decoding**: Parse variable-length opcodes and operands.
- **Text Decoding**: Convert ZSCII to ASCII, handling abbreviations and special characters.
- **Input Parsing**: Tokenize user input and match against the dictionary.

## 5. Development Phases
### 5.1 Phase 1: Core Simulator
- Implement file loading and memory management.
- Support basic opcodes (`print`, `je`, `call`, `ret`).
- Handle text output and basic user input.
- Test with Zork 1 opening sequence.

### 5.2 Phase 2: Full Gameplay
- Add support for object tree, properties, and attributes.
- Implement remaining opcodes (e.g., `get_prop`, `put_prop`, `move`).
- Support dictionary-based input parsing.
- Test full Zork 1 gameplay.

### 5.3 Phase 3: Polish and Optimization
- Add error handling for edge cases.
- Optimize performance for large story files.
- (Optional) Implement save/load functionality.
- (Optional) Develop a GUI interface.

## 6. Dependencies
- **Python 3.8+**: Core language.
- **No external libraries** for core functionality to ensure portability.
- **(Optional) Tkinter or PyQt**: For GUI (stretch goal).
- **Zork 1 Story File**: `.z3` file for testing (assumed to be legally obtained by the user).

## 7. Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Complexity of Z-Machine opcodes.
  - **Mitigation**: Use Z-Machine specification (e.g., Z-Machine Standards Document) and test incrementally.
- **Risk**: Inaccurate emulation breaking Zork 1.
  - **Mitigation**: Validate against known Zork 1 behaviors and use existing interpreters (e.g., Frotz) for reference.
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large instruction sets.
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize critical paths (e.g., instruction decoding) and profile performance.

## 8. Success Criteria
- The simulator can load and run Zork 1 without crashes.
- Core gameplay (navigation, object interaction, text output) matches the original experience.
- User commands are correctly parsed and executed.
- Code is modular, documented, and extensible.
